# Faber REST API Server

This is a REST API version of the Faber agent that replaces the command-line interface with HTTP endpoints. Faber acts as an issuer and verifier in the credential ecosystem.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Install dependencies (if not already done):

```bash
cd demo
npm install
```

## Proof Verification

When Alice accepts a proof request and sends a presentation, Faber automatically:

1. **Receives the presentation** - State changes to `PresentationReceived`
2. **Verifies the proof automatically** - The verification happens in the background
3. **Logs the result** - Console shows whether the proof is VALID ‚úÖ or INVALID ‚ùå
4. **Auto-accepts valid proofs** - Valid presentations are automatically accepted
5. **Completes the flow** - State changes to `Done`

### Verification Console Output

When a proof is received, you'll see output like:

```
üîç Proof state changed: presentation-received
Proof ID: abc123...
‚úÖ Proof received from Alice!
üéâ Proof is VALID! ‚úÖ
Proof verification successful - Alice has provided valid credentials.
‚úÖ Presentation accepted automatically
‚úÖ Proof exchange completed successfully!
```

### Manual Verification Check

You can get detailed verification information:

```bash
# Get verification details for a specific proof
curl http://localhost:3002/proofs/PROOF_ID/verification

# Manually accept a presentation (if auto-accept is disabled)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/proofs/accept-presentation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"proofRecordId": "PROOF_ID_FROM_LOGS"}'
```

### Understanding Verification Results

- **`isVerified: true`** - The proof is cryptographically valid and the credentials are legitimate
- **`isVerified: false`** - The proof failed verification (tampered or invalid credentials)
- **`isVerified: null`** - Verification status unknown (shouldn't normally happen)

The verification checks:

- Cryptographic signatures on the credentials
- That the credentials haven't been tampered with
- That the proof correctly proves the requested attributes
- That the credentials are from the expected issuers
- Cryptographic signatures on the credentials
- That the credentials haven't been tampered with
- That the proof correctly proves the requested attributes
- That the credentials are from the expected issuers

1. **Start the Faber server**: `npm run faber-server`

2. **Check health**: `GET /health`

3. **Create connection invitation**: `POST /connection/create-invitation`

   - Copy the `invitationUrl` from the response
   - Share this URL with Alice or use it in Alice's `/connection/receive-invitation` endpoint

4. **Import DID for issuance**: `POST /did/import` with `{"registry": "did:indy"}`

5. **Issue credential**: `POST /credentials/issue`

   - This will send a credential offer to the connected Alice agent

6. **Request proof**: `POST /proofs/request`

   - This will send a proof request to Alice asking for proof of the issued credential

7. **Monitor states**: Use the GET endpoints to check the status of connections, credentials, and proofs

## Example with curl

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:3002/health

# Create connection invitation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/connection/create-invitation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Import DID
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/did/import \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"registry": "did:indy"}'

# Issue credential
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/credentials/issue \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Request proof
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/proofs/request \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'

# Send message
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/message/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello from Faber!"}'
```

## Integration with Alice

To test the full flow between Faber and Alice:

1. Start both servers:

   - `npm run faber-server` (runs on port 3002)
   - `npm run alice-server` (runs on port 3001)

2. Create connection invitation on Faber:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/connection/create-invitation
   ```

3. Use the returned invitation URL with Alice:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/connection/receive-invitation \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"invitationUrl": "INVITATION_URL_FROM_STEP_2"}'
   ```

4. Import DID on Faber and issue credential:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/did/import \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"registry": "did:indy"}'

   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/credentials/issue
   ```

5. Accept the credential on Alice (check Alice console for credential ID):

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/credentials/accept-offer \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"credentialRecordId": "CREDENTIAL_ID_FROM_CONSOLE"}'
   ```

6. Request proof on Faber:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/proofs/request
   ```

7. Accept proof request on Alice (check Alice console for proof ID):
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/proofs/accept-request \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"proofRecordId": "PROOF_ID_FROM_CONSOLE"}'
   ```

This REST API approach enables easy integration of the Faber issuer/verifier functionality into web applications, mobile apps, or any system that can make HTTP requests.
